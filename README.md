# Telecom Customer Churn Analysis

## 📌 Objective
Analyze customer behavior in a telecom company to identify key factors driving churn and help improve customer retention.

## 📊 Tools & Technologies
- Python
- pandas, NumPy
- Seaborn, Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📁 Dataset
Used a telecom customer dataset with 7,000+ entries containing customer demographics, contract details, usage, and churn status.

## 🔍 Key Analysis Steps
- Cleaned data: handled nulls, fixed data types, and removed duplicates
- Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on churn trends
- Visualized churn distribution by gender, tenure, contract type, and senior citizen status
- Identified churn rate at ~26.5%, especially among month-to-month contract users and short-tenure customers


## ✅ Insights
- Customers on **month-to-month contracts** churn more than long-term users
- **Tenure** plays a significant role — newer users are more likely to churn
- **Senior citizens** have a slightly higher churn tendency
